# Registration Approval Filtering - Changes Summary

## Problem
Users were able to see all registrations regardless of their assigned state/district, instead of only seeing registrations from their assigned areas.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added ApprovalUser Model (`events/models.py`)
- New model to track user assignments to states/districts
- Fields: `user`, `state_code`, `is_state_approver`, `is_district_approver`, `districts`
- Method `get_assignment_display()` for admin display
- Method `matches_approval_user()` in EventRegistration for validation

### 2. Enhanced EventRegistration Model (`events/models.py`)
- Improved `state_code` property for better state matching
- Added `matches_approval_user()` method for validation

### 3. Updated Admin Filtering (`events/admin.py`)
- Added `get_queryset()` method to `EventRegistrationAdmin`
- Filters registrations based on user's ApprovalUser profile:
  - **MP State**: Shows registrations from assigned districts only
  - **Other States**: Shows registrations from assigned state only
  - **Superusers**: See all registrations
  - **Non-approval users**: See no registrations

### 4. Created Migration (`events/migrations/0003_approvaluser.py`)
- Database migration to create ApprovalUser table

### 5. Added Management Command (`events/management/commands/setup_approval_users.py`)
- Command to easily setup approval users
- Usage examples:
  ```bash
  # Setup UP state approver
  python manage.py setup_approval_users --username john --state-code UP
  
  # Setup MP district approver
  python manage.py setup_approval_users --username jane --state-code MP --districts Bhopal Indore
  
  # List all approval users
  python manage.py setup_approval_users --list-users
  ```

## How It Works Now

### For Non-MP States (e.g., UP, RJ, etc.)
1. Create ApprovalUser with `state_code='UP'` and `is_state_approver=True`
2. User will see only registrations where `state` matches "Uttar Pradesh" or "UP"

### For MP State (District-wise)
1. Create ApprovalUser with `state_code='MP'`, `is_district_approver=True`, and `districts=['Bhopal', 'Indore']`
2. User will see only registrations where `city` is in ['Bhopal', 'Indore']

### For Superusers
- Continue to see all registrations without restrictions

## Next Steps
1. Run migration: `python manage.py migrate`
2. Create ApprovalUser records for existing users
3. Test the filtering by logging in as different approval users
4. Verify that each user sees only their assigned registrations
